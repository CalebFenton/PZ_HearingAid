title=Hearing Aid
description=This adds an upgradable hearing aid.
description=
description=Do you constantly take hard of hearing for the stat points and are tired of being deaf all the time? Wish there was a way to progress out of this negative trait? Try the hearing aid.
description=
description=There are four tiers: broken, normal, efficient, and boosted. The broken hearing aid is the most common and will sometimes spawn in desks or zombies. It's useless but it can be repaired and turned into the normal variant fairly easily.
description=
description=The normal variant spawns in the same places but is much more rare. It can be powered with a battery and turned on. If you're deaf, you become hard of hearing. If you have hard of hearing, it's removed. The trade-off is that it uses a lot of battery.
description=
description=The efficient variant behaves as the normal variant but uses much less battery. It's created by optimizing a normal variant with a higher electrical skill and a few components.
description=
description=The boosted variant can be crafted with very high electrical skill and less common components. If you are deaf, this will give you normal hearing. If you are hard of hearing or have normal hearing already, this will give you keen hearing.
